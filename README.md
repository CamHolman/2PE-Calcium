2-Photon Excitation Microscopy Calcium Imaging Analysis
==============================
## Introduction
This repository contatins tools for analyzing GCaMP signaling (CaS) aquired with 2-Photon Excitation Microscopy (2PE).

Specifically, this repo was set up to compare baseline CaS in Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) with pupilometry (see repo: ixianid/pupilometry). Additionally, it contains tools to compare baseline signaling between cortical areas, namely primary visual cortex (V1) and PFC).
